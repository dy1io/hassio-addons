# Hass.io Add-ons by ThePicklenat0r

## About

These are a collection of add-ons for Hass.io that I've either built myself or modified
from another source to serve my needs. Add-ons found here are typically born out
of my own needs, but I publish them here in case anyone else finds them useful.

## Caution

I am not a professional developer and developing Hass.io addons is a way for
me to learn more about the development process. There is a lot of experimentation
and learning on my part, particularly with GitHub Actions and CI/CD.

## Installation

Add the repository url listed below to your Hass.io Add-On Store tab in Home
Assistant. Do not add individual add-on repositories, it will not work.

## Issues

Please only open issues under each add-on's respective repository.

## Thank you

A special thank you to everyone at [Community Hass.io Add-ons][addons-community].
Much of what I've done here is based on their work. I've learned a great deal
about Hass.io and the development process from their project and I really appreciate
all of their work. Be sure to check out their [repository][community-addons-repo]
of add-ons as well.
