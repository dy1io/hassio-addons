# Documentation

## How to use

1. Add the Github repo to your Hass.io: <https://github.com/dy1io/hassio-addons>
2. Install the addon
3. Create an ngrok account and copy your auth key.
4. Configure the options in the addon (see descriptions for each option below).
5. Add this addon to your `trusted_proxies` list in `configuration.yaml`.

    ```yaml
      http:
        use_x_forwarded_for: true
        trusted_proxies:
        - 127.0.0.1
        - 172.30.32.0/24
        - 172.30.33.0/24
    ```

    **Note**: _If you've modified your Supervisor or Docker network you may_
    _need to update the addresses for your system. See [Home Assistant's documentation][trusted_proxies_docs]_
    _for more info._

6. Start the addon
7. Restart Home Assistant Core

**Note**: _If you did not specify a `subdomain` or `hostname` you will need to_
_open the web interface to get your ngrok.io url, or you can use the_
_[API](#home-assistant-integration) to be notified through Home Assistant._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
  log_level: info
  auth_token: my-auth-token
  region: us
  tunnels:
    - name: hass
      proto: tls
      addr: 8123
      hostname: home.example.com
    - name: lets-encrypt
      proto: http
      addr: 80
      bind_tls: false
      hostname: home.example.com
```

## Options

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

### Option: `auth_token`

Set your ngrok authentication token. This option is required if using a custom
`subdomain` or `hostname` or for tunnels other than `http`.

### Option: `region`

Specifies where the ngrok client will connect to host its tunnels. The following
options are available:

| **Option** | **Location**  |
| :--------: | :------------ |
| us         | United States |
| eu         | Europe        |
| ap         | Asia/Pacific  |
| au         | Australia     |
| sa         | South America |
| in         | India         |

### Option: `tunnels`

A list of tunnels. Use the options defined below to create you tunnels. You
must specify at least the `name`, `proto`, and `addr` for each tunnel. For more
details, see [ngrok's documentation][ngrok_docs_tunnels].

| Option        | Protocol  | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`*       | all       | unique name for the tunnel must only use `a-z` `0-9` `-` or `_`                                     |
| `proto`*      | all       | tunnel protocol name, one of http, tcp, tls                                                         |
| `addr`*       | all       | forward traffic to this local port number or network address                                        |
| `inspect`     | all       | enable http request inspection                                                                      |
| `auth`        | http      | HTTP basic authentication credentials to enforce on tunneled requests                               |
| `host_header` | http      | Rewrite the HTTP Host header to this value, or preserve to leave it unchanged                       |
| `bind_tls`    | http      | bind an HTTPS or HTTP endpoint or both true, false, or both                                         |
| `subdomain`   | http, tls | subdomain name to request. If unspecified, uses the tunnel name                                     |
| `hostname`    | http, tls | hostname to request (requires reserved name and DNS CNAME)                                          |
| `crt`         | tls       | PEM TLS certificate at this path to terminate TLS traffic before forwarding locally                 |
| `key`         | tls       | PEM TLS private key at this path to terminate TLS traffic before forwarding locally                 |
| `client_cas`  | tls       | PEM TLS certificate authority at this path will verify incoming TLS client connection certificates. |
| `remote_addr` | tcp       | bind the remote TCP port on the given address                                                       |
| `metadata`    | all       | arbitrary user-defined metadata that will appear in the ngrok service API when listing tunnels      |

## Home Assistant Integration

You can leverage the ngrok client API to expose your tunnel status to Home
Assistant. This is done by creating a REST API sensor in your Home Assistant
`configuration.yaml`.

### Example: Get Public URL

If you want to monitor the public URL that ngrok generates, you can do that through
a [RESTful sensor][rest_docs] in Home Assistant.

1. Add this to your `configuration.yaml` or create a new [package file][packages_docs].

    ``` YAML
    sensor:
      - platform: rest
        resource: http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels/hass
        name: Home Assistant URL
        value_template: '{{ value_json.public_url }}'
    ```

    **Note**: _If you changed the default tunnel name, replace `hass` in the_
              _example with your tunnel name._

2. Reboot Home Assistant Core

Now you will have a sensor called `sensor.home_assistant_url` You could then use
this to create an automation each to alert you of the public url.

### Further reading

You can monitor almost anything about the tunnel as long as it is active.
See [ngrok's api documentation][ngrok_docs_api] for details.
